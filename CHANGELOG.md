# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Status Bar are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **The awaiting-permission dot pings.** It pops and sends out a fading ring every 1.2 s, so a waiting session nudges you instead of just sitting there yellow.
- **A blue "Your turn" ping.** When a reply ends on a question or gives you a `! command` to run, the menu bar pings blue until you answer (or for 30 minutes), so a session waiting on you doesn't look finished.

### Changed
- **A leaner dropdown.** It's now just your sessions, **Settings ›** and **Quit**. Timer, text, animation, color, sound, version and updates all live under Settings.
- **A narrower menu bar.** Status text is one word and only for tools and permission (`Editing`, `Running`, `Waiting`). Plain thinking is icon + timer, and the timer reads `1:03` instead of `1m 3s`.

### Removed
- **The rotating thinking words** (`Manifesting…`, `Percolating…`) from the menu bar.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- **Orbit, Claude's new thinking dots animation style.** Three dots that drift together, merge, orbit each other and settle back out.
- **A toggle to hide the status text.** "Show text" turns the menu bar label off for an icon-only menu bar. On by default. Suggested and first implemented by [@felixradtke](https://github.com/felixradtke) ([#62](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/62)).

### Changed
- **New app icon.** The Orbit dots replace the pixel Clawd.
- **Updated names for the animation styles.** Claude Spark is now **Spark**, Claude Code is now **Unicode**, and Crab Walking is now **Clawd™**. Your saved choice carries over untouched.

### Removed
- **The plain `Thinking…` option.** The old "Thinking words" toggle fell back to a plain `Thinking…` when switched off. The status text is now either the rotating words or nothing at all.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-08-05

### Changed
- **Meaningfully lower CPU usage.** Four fixes, all measured: the menu bar title is no longer rebuilt and re-rendered on every animation frame (it only changes once a second), animation frames are cached instead of being redrawn each step, the "is the Claude desktop app running?" check moved from a query on every poll to a system notification, and each session's transcript is only re-read when it actually changes rather than 2.5 times a second per session.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| idle, resting icon | 2.0% | **1.2%** |
| Claude Spark animating | 5.5% | **3.8%** |
| Crab Walking animating | 6.6% | **4.7%** |
| 10 sessions working at once | 9.1% | **4.8%** |
| 20 sessions working at once | 11.5% | **5.5%** |

  Percentages are share of one CPU core, measured over fixed windows on an M1 Pro. The more sessions you run at once, the bigger the difference: the old code did per-session file reads on every poll, so cost grew with each live session. Found and diagnosed by [@Bardin08](https://github.com/Bardin08) ([#53](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/issues/53)).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **Completion Sound has an "Every turn" option.** The chime can now play the moment any turn finishes, instead of only after turns of a minute or longer. Still off by default.

### Changed
- New app icon.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Hooks no longer break when Homebrew upgrades Node.** The installer used to write the exact Node binary path into the hook commands, which for Homebrew-installed Node includes the version number, so the next `brew upgrade node` left every hook pointing at a deleted directory: no status, no icon, and no self-heal (that lives in the hooks too). Hook commands now resolve `node` at run time through stable locations instead. If your icon silently died at some point and never came back, this was probably you: install this update and launch the app once. Found, diagnosed, and fixed by [@pedrol2b](https://github.com/pedrol2b) ([#48](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/48)), who also contributed the repo's first automated test suite.


## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **Installing while a Claude Code session is already open no longer looks broken.** The app still quits a few seconds after the first launch (nothing to show yet), but now the hooks relaunch it the moment any session does anything, including sessions that were open before you installed. Previously the icon stayed gone until you started a brand-new session. Thanks to [@Bardin08](https://github.com/Bardin08) for the model bug report and root-cause analysis ([#44](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/issues/44)).
- Quit still means quit: quitting from the menu suppresses the relaunch until your next new Claude Code session (or you open the app yourself).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Homebrew!** Install (or switch over from an existing DMG install) with `brew install --cask claude-status-bar && open -a "Claude Status Bar"`. The launch at the end is required: it installs the Claude Code hooks, and on a switch-over it also removes your old copy. See [HOMEBREW.md](HOMEBREW.md) for the full story.
- **The update line in the menu is now brew-aware.** Installed via brew: "Update via brew" appears with a copy button (click, paste in your terminal) and only once Homebrew can actually deliver the new version (the cask lags a release by up to a day). Installed via DMG: "Update available" opens the releases page as before, plus a "Switch to Homebrew" copy button.
- **Completion sound is back**, now as a Completion Sound menu with a length threshold (Off / 1 min+ / 5 min+ / 15 min+) instead of a single on/off toggle. It chimes when a turn that ran at least the chosen length finishes, per session, and is off by default.

### Changed
- **The app bundle is renamed to "Claude Status Bar.app"** (was `ClaudeStatusBar.app`), matching the app's name and its Homebrew cask token. One-time transition: on first launch the app removes the old-named copy from /Applications (after verifying by bundle identifier that it really is this app), so updating over the rename never leaves two copies. Scripts pointing at the old path need the new, quoted path.
- The dropdown timer is now the same size as the session name and sits on its baseline, so it reads as part of the row instead of floating slightly high.
- The working spinner in the dropdown is a touch smaller.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Session rows show the git branch** next to the project name ("myrepo · fix-auth"), read straight from `.git/HEAD` (no `git` invocation), works for worktrees, shows a short SHA when detached, shows nothing outside a repo. Updates on session activity and on opening the menu, so a folder that becomes a repo mid-session (git init, first branch) is picked up live. Thanks to [@ethan0905](https://github.com/ethan0905) ([#37](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/37)).
- **Same-named projects are told apart.** When two live sessions share a folder name (two clones or worktrees of one repo), rows qualify it with the parent folder: "work/myrepo" vs "tmp/myrepo". Hovering a row shows the full name, branch, and path.

### Fixed
- The dropdown timer now sits on the same text baseline as the session name instead of floating slightly high.
- Long session names keep constant letter spacing on every row; a name that does not fit truncates with an ellipsis instead of being subtly squished next to the timer.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- The working spinner in the dropdown is now the native macOS spinner. It is smoother and looks cleaner, especially in dark mode.
- Menu cleanup: Animation and Color are their own menu items now, instead of one combined Settings menu. Idle sessions hide after a fixed 15 minutes (the interval picker was removed).

### Removed
- The completion sound, and its toggle.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Thinking words: the menu bar now rotates through playful verbs while working, more like Claude Code. On by default; toggle it in the menu.

### Changed
- Condensed the settings into a single Settings menu.
- Completion sound now chimes only after turns longer than 5 minutes (was 1 minute).

### Known issues
- Upstream Claude Code bug: pressing Ctrl+C during the reasoning phase in the terminal can leave the icon stuck on a thinking word, since Claude Code emits no hook or transcript signal for that interrupt. Sending your next prompt clears it.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Idle sessions no longer vanish from the menu bar. The icon now follows the live session: it stays while Claude is running and clears when you close it.
- The session list never goes empty: there's always a session to click, or an "Open Claude" shortcut when only the desktop app is open.

### Changed
- Desktop conversations appear only once you work in them, so clicking through conversations no longer clutters the list. Terminal and editor sessions still show the moment they start.
- Menu polish: the session spinner matches the row text, a smaller timer, a tidier Options section, and a light-mode toggle you can actually see.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Multi-session support.** The menu bar now tracks every running Claude Code session at once instead of one at a time. When several are active it surfaces the most important one in the bar (a session awaiting your permission outranks one that's working, which outranks idle) and lists them all in the dropdown.
- **Session dropdown.** Each running session gets its own row showing its project, a live status icon (a spinner while working, an amber dot when it needs your approval, a caret when resting), an elapsed timer, and a CLI or APP tag for where it's running.
- **Click a session to jump to it.** Clicking a desktop-app session brings the Claude app forward; clicking a terminal session brings its terminal app forward. Heads up: it raises the terminal app, not a specific window or tab, so if you have several terminal windows open it surfaces your most recent one, not necessarily the exact session you clicked. Precise per-tab focus is in progress: [issue #19](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/issues/19).
- **Hide idle sessions** after a delay you choose (5, 15, or 30 minutes, 1 hour, or never), so the list stays focused on what's active.
- **Intel Mac support.** The app now ships as a universal binary and runs natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
- **Crab Walking adapts to the color theme.** In System mode the pixel-art crab now renders as a shaded monochrome silhouette that matches the menu bar; Orange mode keeps it full-color. Thanks to @florianheysen for the original implementation.

### Changed
- The menu is now organized around sessions: a Sessions list at the top, with Options, animation, and color settings below.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- Fixed install for nvm/fnm users. The hook setup only looked for Node on the login shell's PATH, so the menu bar icon would show but never animate. It now checks the common Node locations and falls back to your interactive shell. Stuck installs heal on the next launch.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- Edge case where closing the app (or the Claude desktop app) mid-animation left the menu bar stuck. On reopen it would still show the old "thinking" state with the timer climbing, because a force-quit fires no Stop hook. The status now resets to the idle resting icon when the owning session ends or resumes.
- The menu bar no longer parks on "Waiting for you" after a turn. Claude Code's CLI sends an idle notification ("Claude is waiting for your input") when a session sits idle, and the app was turning that into a persistent label. Now only permission notifications affect the icon, so it simply rests when idle.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- **Awaiting-permission dot now works in the Claude desktop app**, not just the terminal CLI. Previously the yellow "awaiting permission" dot only appeared in the CLI, because the only signal we had (the `Notification` hook) never fires for permission prompts in the desktop app. The app now also listens to Claude Code's `PermissionRequest` hook, which fires the moment an approval dialog is shown in both the CLI and the desktop app, so the dot lights up the instant Claude is waiting on you to approve a tool.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Crab Walking** animation style: a pixel-art Clawd crab that scuttles in the menu bar while Claude works. Pick it under Animation. It's always its orange pixel-art self (the Claude and Claude Code styles still follow the Orange/System color setting).
- Optional **completion sound**: a soft chime when a turn longer than a minute finishes. Off by default, toggle it under Options.
- **Version and update check** in the menu: shows your current version, plus a one-click "Update available" that opens the latest release when there's a newer one. The check is a once-a-day read of GitHub's public release tag; no data is collected and nothing is sent to the developer.
- Menu **section headers** (Options / Animation / Color) for easier navigation.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- The app no longer quits while a session that was already running before you installed it is actively working. Such a session never fired its one-time `SessionStart` hook, so it wasn't being tracked, even though its other hooks fire normally. The status hooks now register the session on any activity, so any actively-working session keeps the icon alive. (Thanks to the bug report that pinned this down.)

## [0.0.4] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- The app now actually runs on macOS 12 (Monterey) and later, as the README states. Earlier builds were compiled without a pinned deployment target, so the binary inherited the build machine's OS (macOS 26) and refused to launch on anything older, despite the stated 12.0 requirement. The build now targets macOS 12.0 explicitly.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Reworked how the icon appears on desktop-app launch. The app is now started by the existing session hook (which fires when the Claude desktop app opens, when `claude` runs in a terminal, or when a conversation is opened) and quits itself when Claude is closed and no session is active. This keeps the "icon appears when the desktop app opens" behavior from 0.0.2 with no background helper.

### Removed
- The background watcher (a `launchd` LaunchAgent running a shell script) introduced in 0.0.2. It showed up as a "bash" item under Login Items and Extensions, which was confusing. There is no longer any login item or background item. Upgrading from 0.0.2 removes the old LaunchAgent automatically.

### Fixed
- The menu bar icon now reliably disappears when you quit the Claude desktop app, detected directly rather than relying on the session-end hook (which is unreliable during app shutdown).
- Upgrades now self-heal: the app re-runs its installer when the version changes, so updating from an older version refreshes the hooks and removes the old background watcher without any manual step. Previously the installer only ran on a first-ever install.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Desktop app watcher: the menu bar icon now appears the moment the Claude desktop app opens, before you start a conversation, and disappears shortly after you quit it. Previously the icon only showed once a session began. Implemented as a lightweight `launchd` LaunchAgent that tracks the Claude desktop process (installed via `install.js`, removed via `uninstall.js`).

### Changed
- Ending a Claude Code session no longer hides the icon while the Claude desktop app is still open.

### Fixed
- Uninstall now removes all of the app's own hooks, including the `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` lifecycle hooks that a previous version left behind. It only ever touches this app's hooks, never any others.

### Notes
- The desktop watcher is part of the DMG / standalone install path. The Claude Code plugin install path keeps the session-only behavior.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Initial release: macOS menu bar status indicator for Claude Code, driven entirely by Claude Code hooks.
- Animated Claude spark, elapsed turn timer, and an "awaiting permission" dot.
- Two animation styles (Claude, Claude Code) and two color modes (Orange, System), persisted in preferences.
- Refcounted session lifecycle: launches when Claude Code opens, quits when the last session ends.
- Signed and notarized DMG so it opens without a Gatekeeper warning.
- Claude Code plugin marketplace manifest for the plugin install path.
